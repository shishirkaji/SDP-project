# Seminar Management System
Seminar Management System is a small Express application that part as an assignment for System Development Project subject at University of Technology Sydney. This project is copyright by Group 17

## Project purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide the business requirements for a new seminar hosting system within a company. The document sets context, provides details with regards to functional and non-functional requirements, and also looks into data requirements for this new system. 

## Business purpose
The Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology(FEIT) have a requirement for a new, simple and efficient seminar booking system. At the moment FEIT only has a seminar booking system that handles large, multi-day seminars/events. This project is being created to provide the support needed to run a small seminar/workshop. We have scoped the new system and proposing to implement this new system to complement the existing system.

Building the new system will help to smooth the process of booking a seminar. Furthermore, the project will be able to expanded upon in the future to add new functionality and adapt to the changing requirements of the faculty.
